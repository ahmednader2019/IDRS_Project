# IDRS_Project


"My graduation project was meticulously developed to address the critical issue of reducing traffic accidents. This comprehensive system encompasses Authentication, Authorization, and role-based access control for enhanced security.

Within this system, the admin can input driver information, triggering the delivery of a confirmation message via Gmail to the user. In cases where a driver experiences a health problem that renders them unable to drive, our system employs a smartwatch to detect the issue and promptly sends a notification to the website, providing detailed information. Subsequently, the car is automatically categorized as a 'dangerous' vehicle within the system.

The admin enjoys a range of functionalities. Firstly, they can monitor the real-time location of the car on a website, thanks to the integration of the Google Maps API. This information is updated every two minutes via a dedicated mobile application used by drivers. Secondly, in emergencies, the admin can send an SMS containing the driver's location and health problem to facilitate prompt assistance.

Moreover, our system empowers remote control of the vehicle. Utilizing sensors and cameras, it streams live feeds to the website, allowing the admin to guide the car to the nearest safe location. This remote control capability is implemented using Python and Flask.

Upon reaching safety, the car is automatically reclassified as 'safe' within the system. The system also features a dashboard that provides insightful statistics, including the count of dangerous cars, stable cars, and safe cars. Additionally, the dashboard supports real-time chat functionality, enabling seamless communication between users and administrators."
